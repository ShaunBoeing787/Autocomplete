# 🔮 Advanced Autocomplete System

An intelligent **Autocomplete Suggestion Engine** built using a **Trie data structure**, enhanced with ranking, typo handling, and dynamic scalability features. This project aims to deliver a smooth, fast, and context-aware typing experience — similar to modern search bars or IDE autocompletes.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Core Functionality

* **Trie-based Autocomplete** – Efficient word storage and prefix-based lookup.
* **Instant Suggestions** – Returns word completions as you type.

### ⚡ Advanced Features

#### 1. Ranking / Scoring

* Each word in the Trie stores a **frequency counter**.
* When users select a suggestion, its frequency increases.
* Suggestions are **ranked and sorted** based on popularity, ensuring the most relevant results appear first.

#### 2. Case Insensitivity

* Handles both uppercase and lowercase input seamlessly.
* All data and user input are normalized (converted to lowercase) to ensure **consistent matching**.

#### 3. Handling Typos ✍️

* Integrates **Levenshtein Distance** to handle minor spelling mistakes.
* Finds and suggests words **within a defined edit distance** (e.g., 1–2 character differences).

#### 4. Dynamic Data 🔄

* Supports **real-time updates**:

  * Add new words as users type.
  * Delete or modify words dynamically.
* Can connect to a **database or live API** to fetch fresh data and keep suggestions up to date.

#### 5. Scalability for Large Datasets 🧩

* For massive datasets (millions of entries), optimized structures like:

  * **Ternary Search Trees (TST)** for space efficiency.
  * **Distributed Tries** across multiple servers for horizontal scaling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python / JavaScript (depending on your implementation)
* **Data Structure:** Trie / Ternary Search Tree
* **Optional Libraries:**

  * `difflib` or `editdistance` for typo handling
  * `Flask` or `Express` for backend integration
  * `React` or `Vanilla JS` for frontend demo

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Insert words** into the Trie (from a file, API, or manually).
2. As the user types a prefix, the system:

   * Traverses the Trie to find matching nodes.
   * Collects and ranks possible completions.
   * Optionally, finds typo-tolerant matches using edit distance.
3. The **top-ranked suggestions** are displayed in real time.

## 📈 Future Improvements

* ✅ Context-aware predictions using NLP
* ✅ Caching for faster lookups
* ✅ Integration with web or mobile frontends
* ✅ Personalized ranking based on user history

## 🧪 Example

**Input:**

```
User types: "pro"
```

**Output Suggestions:**

```
["program", "project", "progress", "problem"]
```

**After multiple users choose “project”:**

```
["project", "program", "progress", "problem"]
```
